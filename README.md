# Twitinder Game

A little app to match up Twitter Users based on Similar Likes.

If you want to play around with it, go ahead. Just install it using the 'npm install' method to get it up and running.

## Dependancies

There is only one dependency, thats the Bootstrap CSS file. 

There is a Gulp file that runs some simple tasks:

- SASS File, just for the basics.
- Javascript, just to convert any ES6 features I use over with Babel.
- Browsersync, just for that lovely ease of use.



## Notes

The project is all built within the folder: **app**

The project is all output to the folder: **client**
